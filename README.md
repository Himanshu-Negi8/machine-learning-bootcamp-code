# Machine Learning Code

  Repo consist of code of numpy,pandas,matplotlib and other libraries that are used in machine learning.
# Standar Deviation
  Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value. 
  A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.
  
# Mean
  Mean is given by the total of the values of the samples divided by the number of samples. In mathematical terms this would mean:
  x̄ is the mean and there are n values of x. Σ means that you need to take the sum of all the data points.
